          <h1 class="title">Biochemistry</h1>
          <p>Biochemistry is the study of the structure, composition, and chemical reactions of substances in living systems. Biochemistry emerged as a separate discipline when scientists combined biology with organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry and began to study how living things obtain energy from food, the chemical basis of heredity, and what fundamental changes occur in disease, and related issues. Biochemistry includes the sciences of molecular biology, immunochemistry, and neurochemistry, as well as bioinorganic, bioorganic, and biophysical chemistry.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Introduction of DNA</h1>
          <p>DNA(deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms.Nearly every cell in a personâ€™s body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus. The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people. The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism. DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs. Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule.</p>

              <p class="card-text">(C6H12O6, also known as D-glucose, dextrose, or grape sugar) is a simple sugar (monosaccharide) and an important carbohydrate in biology. Cells use it as a source of energy and a metabolic intermediate. Glucose is one of the main products of photosynthesis and starts cellular respiration.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Amino acids are molecules containing an amine group(NH2), a carboxylic acid group(R-C=O-OH) and a side-chain( usually denoted as R) that varies between different amino acids. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Protein</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Proteins are a primary constituent of living things and one of the chief classes of molecules studied in biochemistry. Proteins provide most of the molecular machinery of cells. Many are enzymes or subunits of enzymes. Other proteins play structural or mechanical roles, such as those that form the struts and joints of the cytoskeleton. Each protein is linear polymers built of amino acids. Proteins are also nutrient sources for organisms that do not produce their own energy from sunlight and/or are unable to fix nitrogen. Proteins can interact with one another and with other molecules to form complexes.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Enzymes and Energy</h1>
          <p>How our bodies turn food into energy: Our bodies digest the food we eat by mixing it with fluids (acids and enzymes) in the stomach. When the stomach digests food, carbohydrates (sugars and starches) in the food breaks down into another type of sugar, called glucose. The stomach and small intestines absorb the glucose and then release it into the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, glucose can be used immediately for energy or stored in our bodies, to be used later.</p>
